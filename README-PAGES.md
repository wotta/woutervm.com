## 🛠 Installation & Setup

1. **Run the migration**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Seed sample data** (optional):
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed --class=PageSeeder
   ```

3. **Access the admin panel**:
   - Go to `/admin/pages` to manage pages
   - Create, edit, and organize your content

4. **View pages on frontend**:
   - Individual pages: `/{slug}` or `/{parent-slug}/{child-slug}`
   - All pages: `/pages`
   - Search: `/pages/search?q=query`
   - By template: `/pages/template/{template}`

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Creating a New Page
1. Go to `/admin/pages`
2. Click "New Page"
3. Fill in title, content, and settings
4. Choose template and status
5. Save and publish

### Page Hierarchy
- Create parent pages (e.g., "Services")
- Add child pages with the parent selected (e.g., "Laravel Development" under "Services")
- URLs automatically become `/services/laravel-development`

### Templates
Each template provides different layouts:
- **Default**: Standard content pages
- **Landing**: Marketing/campaign pages
- **About**: Personal/company info
- **Contact**: Contact forms and info
- **Portfolio**: Work showcase
- **Blog**: Article content
- **Custom**: Unique layouts

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Templates
1. Add template to `Page::getAvailableTemplates()` in the model
2. Update the controller's template handling
3. Add template-specific styling in components

### Custom Styling
- Use the page settings to add custom CSS per page
- Modify the `page-content.tsx` component for global styling changes
- Template-specific styles can be added based on the template type

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Database Structure
- Pages table with hierarchical support (parent_id)
- JSON fields for meta_data and settings
- Proper indexing for performance
- Support for file/image attachments

### Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authorization checks in Filament
- XSS prevention in content rendering
- Secure file upload handling

### Performance
- Database query optimization with proper indexes
- Lazy loading of relationships
- Efficient pagination
- Caching considerations built-in

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Pages not showing**: Check if they're published and have correct status
2. **Images not displaying**: Verify storage configuration and file permissions
3. **Slugs not working**: Ensure unique slugs and proper routing order
4. **Filament access**: Check user permissions and domain restrictions

### Debug Steps
1. Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify database data: Check pages table content
3. Test routes: Use `php artisan route:list` to verify routes
4. Clear caches: `php artisan cache:clear` and `php artisan config:clear`
